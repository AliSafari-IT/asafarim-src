## Axios library
Axios is a popular JavaScript library that is used for making HTTP requests from a web browser or Node.js server. It provides a simple and easy-to-use API for making HTTP requests, handling errors, and managing responses.

An Axios plugin is a piece of code that extends the functionality of Axios by adding new features or modifying existing ones. Plugins can be used to add functionality such as request/response interceptors, global settings, and custom headers.

For example, you can use an Axios plugin to add a custom header to all HTTP requests made using Axios. Here's an example code snippet for adding a custom header using an Axios plugin:

```js title="An Axios plugin example"
    import axios from 'axios';

    const myPlugin = {
    install(Vue) {
        axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 'Bearer myToken';
    }
    };

    Vue.use(myPlugin);
```

Axios plugins can be used to customize and extend the functionality of Axios to fit your specific project requirements.
