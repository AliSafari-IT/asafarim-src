    <tr>
      <th>Create a test plan</th>
      <td>In Azure DevOps, navigate to the "Test Plans" tab and click on "New Test Plan". Give your test plan a name and select the project and area path that it should be associated with.</td>

    <tr>
      <th>Create test suites</th>

      Once you have created a test plan, you can create one or more test suites within the test plan. Test suites are used to group together related test cases. To create a test suite, click on the test plan, then click on "New Suite". Give your test suite a name and description.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Create test cases</th>
      <td>Within each test suite, you can create one or more test cases. Test cases are used to define the steps and expected results for each test scenario. To create a test case, click on the test suite, then click on "New Test Case". Fill in the details for the test case, including the title, description, and steps.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      <td>Once you have created your test cases, you can run them as part of a test run. To create a test run, click on the test plan, then click on "New Test Run". Select the test suite and test cases that you want to run, then click on "Start Test Run". Follow the prompts to run the tests and record the results.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>View test results</th>
       <td> After the test run is complete, you can view the results in the "Test Results" tab. This will show you a summary of the test run, including the number of tests that passed and failed. You can also drill down into individual test cases to see the steps and expected results, as well as any defects that were found during the test run.</td>
