    <tr>
      <th>Environment consistency</th>
      <td>Ensure that the test environment is consistent with the production environment where the application will ultimately be deployed. This includes factors such as the operating system, hardware, network configuration, and other software dependencies.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Test data</th>      
      <td>Ensure that the test data used in the test environment is representative of the data that will be used in the production environment. This ensures that your tests are testing the application with realistic data and scenarios.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Test coverage</th>      
      <td>Ensure that the test environment provides adequate test coverage for the application. This includes testing all of the application's functionality, including edge cases and error conditions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Performance and scalability</th>  
          <td>Ensure that the test environment can handle the expected load and traffic that the application will receive in production. This includes testing the application's performance and scalability under different conditions, such as high traffic or heavy load.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>Security</th>   
         <td>Ensure that the test environment provides adequate security measures to protect the application and its data. This includes testing the application's security features and ensuring that the test environment is properly secured.</td>
