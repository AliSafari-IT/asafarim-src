Azure App Service and Azure DevOps Services are two different services provided by Microsoft.

Azure App Service is a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering for hosting web apps, mobile app backends, and RESTful APIs. It provides built-in support for .NET, Node.js, Java, Python, PHP, and Ruby, as well as the ability to run custom Docker containers. It also provides features such as auto-scaling, load balancing, and integration with other Azure services.

Azure DevOps Services, on the other hand, is a set of cloud services for collaborating on code development, testing, and deployment. It includes features such as version control, agile planning tools, continuous integration and delivery, testing and analytics, and more. It is designed to help teams manage their software development lifecycle more efficiently.

So, while Azure App Service is focused on hosting and running web and mobile apps, Azure DevOps Services is focused on managing the software development process.
