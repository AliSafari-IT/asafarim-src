title: "Developer Tools"

Developer tools are software applications or programs that help software developers write, test, debug, and deploy their code. These tools can include code editors, integrated development environments (IDEs), version control systems, debuggers, compilers, and testing frameworks. They are designed to make the development process more efficient and effective, by providing features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, error checking, and automation of repetitive tasks. Developer tools can be specific to a particular programming language or technology stack, or they can be more general-purpose tools that work across multiple languages and platforms.
