XML, which stands for Extensible Markup Language, is a markup language used to store and transport data in a structured format. It provides a way to describe the structure and content of a document or data source using tags and attributes.

In XML, data is enclosed in tags, which describe the meaning and purpose of the data. For example, a tag might indicate that the enclosed data represents a person's name, address, or phone number. Tags can also be nested inside other tags to create a hierarchy of data.

XML is designed to be extensible, which means that developers can create custom tags and attributes to describe data that is specific to their application or domain. This makes it a flexible and powerful language for representing complex data structures.

XML is widely used in web development, as well as in many other applications such as data storage, data exchange, and configuration files. It is also often used in conjunction with other technologies such as XSLT and XPath to transform and query XML data.
