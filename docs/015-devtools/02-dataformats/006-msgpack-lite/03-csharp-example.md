HHere's an example of how to use MessagePack in .NET Core 3.1 or later with C# using the _MessagePack_ NuGet package:

First, you need to install the package:

```c#
Install-Package MessagePack
```

Then, you can use the MessagePack library to serialize and deserialize your objects:

```csharp
import * as msgpack from 'msgpack-lite';

// Define your object
const obj = { name: 'Alice', age: 30, email: ['alice@example.com'] };

// Encode the object as a MessagePack buffer
const buffer = msgpack.encode(obj);

// Decode the buffer back into an object
const decodedObj = msgpack.decode(buffer);

console.log(decodedObj); // { name: 'Alice', age: 30, email: ['alice@example.com'] }
```

This code defines an object obj, encodes it as a MessagePack buffer using msgpack.encode, and decodes the buffer back into an object using msgpack.decode. The resulting decodedObj should be the same as the original obj.

Note that msgpack-lite supports a wide range of data types, including arrays, maps, numbers, and strings. You can find more information about how to use the library in the official documentation: https://github.com/kawanet/msgpack-lite
