JSON is an open standard file format and data interchange format that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and arrays. It is a very common data format, with a diverse range of applications, one example being web applications that communicate with a server.<br/>
A JSON string can be stored in its own file, which is basically just a text file with an extension of .json, and a [MIME type](/docs/content-type-mime) of application/json.

## Who Invented JSON?

`Douglas Crockford`

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) was first introduced in 2001 by Douglas Crockford, a software engineer at Yahoo. He created it as a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. Since then, it has become a popular format for data exchange between web clients and servers.
Douglas Crockford originally specified the JSON format in the early 2000s.
