Developers document the code to ensure that it can be understood by other developers and maintained over time.

The coding stage is a critical component of software development, as it is where the actual implementation of the software takes place. By following best practices for writing, testing, and documenting the code, developers can ensure that the software is of high quality and meets the requirements of the stakeholders.
