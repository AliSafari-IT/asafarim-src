title: "Code-based testing"

Code-based testing involves using automated testing tools to check whether software code behaves as expected under different conditions and inputs. This type of testing is often performed by developers during the software development process, and it involves writing test cases that check the functionality of individual code modules or components.

In code-based testing, the test cases are written in code and are executed automatically by testing tools. The tools simulate various inputs and scenarios to ensure that the code behaves correctly and produces the expected outputs. This helps to catch bugs and errors early in the development process, before the software is released to users.

Code-based testing is a key part of modern software development, as it helps to ensure that software is reliable, robust, and performs as intended. It is often used in conjunction with other types of testing, such as manual testing and user acceptance testing, to provide a comprehensive testing strategy.
