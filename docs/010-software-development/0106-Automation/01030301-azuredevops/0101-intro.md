## In brief
It is a Microsoft product that provides a set of development tools for software teams to plan, develop, test, deploy, and collaborate on software projects. It includes a variety of features such as version control, agile planning tools, build and release management, and test management. It can be used either on-premises or in the cloud, and it integrates with a variety of third-party tools and services.

## Why Azure DevOps?
In today's fast-paced software development world, where businesses are under constant pressure to deliver high-quality software quickly, DevOps provides a framework for achieving this by automating the software delivery process, reducing errors, and increasing the speed of deployment.

DevOps also helps to improve the reliability, security, and scalability of software systems, and it allows teams to respond quickly to changing requirements and customer needs. Overall, DevOps is essential for modern software development and is becoming increasingly important for businesses to remain competitive in the marketplace.

## Azure DevOps alternatives
There are several alternatives to Azure DevOps, including:

-   Jenkins: an open-source automation server that can be used for building, testing, and deploying software.

-   GitLab: a web-based Git repository manager that includes CI/CD pipelines, code review tools, and project management features.

-   Atlassian Bamboo: a continuous integration and deployment tool that integrates with other Atlassian products such as JIRA, Bitbucket, and Confluence.

-   CircleCI: a cloud-based platform for continuous integration and delivery that supports a variety of programming languages and environments.

-   Travis CI: a distributed continuous integration service that is designed to work with GitHub repositories.

-   AWS CodePipeline: a fully managed continuous delivery service that automates the release process for software applications.

Each of these tools has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of which one to use will depend on specific project requirements, team preferences, and budget constraints.
