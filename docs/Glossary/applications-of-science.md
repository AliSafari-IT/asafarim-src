An application of science is any use of scientific knowledge for a specific purpose, whether to do more science; to design a product, process, or medical treatment; to develop a new technology; or to predict the impacts of human actions.

> Applications of science refer to the practical uses of scientific knowledge and discoveries in various fields, including technology, engineering, medicine, and more. These applications can help solve real-world problems and improve people's lives in a variety of ways.

For example, scientific knowledge in the fields of chemistry and materials science has led to the development of new materials with unique properties, such as lightweight and durable composites used in aircraft and automobiles. Advances in computer science and artificial intelligence have enabled the development of sophisticated algorithms that are used in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous vehicles.

In medicine, scientific research has led to the development of new drugs, medical devices, and therapies that can treat and cure diseases. For example, the discovery of antibiotics revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections, and the development of vaccines has led to the eradication of many deadly diseases such as smallpox.

Overall, applications of science have the potential to improve our lives in countless ways and can help us solve some of the world's most pressing problems.
