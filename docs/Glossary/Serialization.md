## In brief
Encoding and serialization are the same thing â†’ turning a data structure into a string. 

## In details
Serialization is the process of converting an object or data structure into a format that can be stored or transmitted. In the context of JSON, serialization refers to the process of converting a JavaScript object into a JSON string so that it can be sent over the network or stored in a file. Similarly, deserialization is the process of converting a JSON string back into a JavaScript object.

In practice, JSON is often used to represent data structures in web applications and APIs. For example, a server might send a JSON string that represents a list of blog posts to a client, and the client can then parse the JSON string into a JavaScript object and use it to display the blog posts on a webpage. Similarly, a client might send a JSON string that represents user input to a server, and the server can then parse the JSON string into a data structure that can be used to update a database or perform some other action.
