Engineering is a systematic and often iterative approach to designing objects, processes, and systems to meet human needs and wants.

## Engineering in Computer Sciences
Engineering in computer science refers to the application of scientific and mathematical principles to design, develop, and maintain computer systems and software. Computer science engineering involves the use of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and other tools and techniques to create efficient and effective software systems.

Computer science engineering includes a wide range of sub-disciplines, including:

•   Software engineering: The design, development, and maintenance of software systems, including methodologies for software development, testing, and deployment.

•   Computer hardware engineering: The design and development of computer hardware components, including processors, memory, and input/output devices.

•   Computer networks and communications engineering: The design and development of computer networks and communication protocols, including wired and wireless networks, network security, and data transmission protocols.

•   Database engineering: The design and development of database systems, including data modeling, storage, retrieval, and management.

•   Artificial intelligence and machine learning engineering: The development of systems that can learn from data and make decisions based on that data, including natural language processing, computer vision, and predictive analytics.

Overall, engineering in computer science involves the application of engineering principles and practices to create software systems that are efficient, reliable, and effective.
