Identifying the most pressing or important challenge in automation and lab automation can depend on various factors, such as the specific industry, organization, or application of automation. However, here are some common challenges that are often considered most pressing or important in automation and lab automation respectively:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Opportunities</th>
    <th>Challenges</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Increased efficiency and accuracy of lab processes</td>
    <td>Cost of implementing automation</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Improved reproducibility of experiments</td>
    <td>Complexity of lab processes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ability to handle large volumes of data</td>
    <td>Integration with existing lab systems</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Improved safety of lab personnel</td>
    <td>Training of staff on how to use automated systems</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td></td>
    <td>Temporary shut down of lab operations during implementation</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Technically, one of the most common concerns in lab automation is ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of automated processes. Lab automation systems may introduce errors or variations that can impact experimental results. 
Therefore, it is critical to validate and verify the performance of automated systems to ensure that they are producing accurate and reliable results. Additionally, it is important to establish standard operating procedures (SOPs) and quality control measures to ensure that automated processes are consistent and reproducible over time.
